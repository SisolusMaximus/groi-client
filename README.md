# GROI


## Overview
  
GROI is my personal project built as a final project of one of the subjects during getting an degree. It’s far from being pefect, especially in terms of UI/UX design but it implements elements that are present in most applications today: authentication and authorization with 2FA is some places, back-end database, responsive UI for mobile users, simple search system, automated sending emails to users and many more.
