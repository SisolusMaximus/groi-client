# GROI


## Overview
  
GROI is my personal project built as a final project of one of the subjects during getting an degree. Itâ€™s far from being pefect, especially in terms of UI/UX design but it implements elements that are present in most applications today: authentication and authorization with 2FA is some places, back-end database, responsive UI for mobile users, simple search system, automated sending emails to users and many more. This application is currently deployed on Heroku, You can use this link to visit it and play around: [https://groi.herokuapp.com/](https://groi.herokuapp.com/)
